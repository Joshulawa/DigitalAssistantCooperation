# Kanban Board:
Add milestones to tasks such as MVP, beta , final product.
Make sure there are tasks in the todo column.
Assign issues to induviduals.

# MVP:
Due around 5 - 10th December but we need to have it ready before then as CSA is due around that time.

Our MVP should focus on getting messaging between Genies working through the Genie terminal via a messaging service - most likely Matrix
Can make a UML diagram of our product to make it easier to delegate the tasks.

# To do:
Set up github correctly.
Everyone -> Complete the preparation tasks such as user stories and initial stakeholders.
Xander -> Investigate Genie and create an instance of it for us to explore and test.
