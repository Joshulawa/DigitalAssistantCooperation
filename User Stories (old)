- As a parent, I want to keep in touch with my child by requesting their whereabouts or checking in on their wellbeing, adjusting the formality of language appropriately. The digital assistant should be able to recognise which contacts are their children.
- As a child, I want to be able to message my carers with ease, especially if parental restrictions have been put on devices, to send messages such as ‘what time’s dinner?’ or share my location. 
- As a family member, I want to keep in touch with family, request family photos and send messages such as ‘love you’. Especially if I am an older family member less experienced with technology, digital assistant should be easy to use.
- As a university student, I want to communicate with coursemates to exchange notes and assignment help. Given a prompt to ask for some kind of support from coursemates (clarifying lecture times, explaining content, sending resources) Genie should identify who the user’s coursemates are (perhaps even identify a group chat) and ask the appropriate questions.
- As a friend, I want to message other friends using more casual language to arrange to meet up, catch up or ask for photos from a night out. Given that there will be some individuals that the user will message very regularly, Genie should be able to identify who their best friends or close family are. 
- As a business owner or professional, I want to increase time efficiency by sending admin messages to clients or associates hands free. 
- As a colleague, I want to message other people in my company using formal language to request information, data and documents with a high level of security. This would be ideal if Genie could also be used over email.
- The virtual assistant will benefit those who are visually or physically impaired, as it will use voice recognition to send messages hands free, but as a disabled person I would want the assurance of knowing the right message is sent to the right person.
