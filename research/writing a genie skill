Following the Stanford Genie development wiki: 
https://wiki.almond.stanford.edu/en/genie-guide

Basic process goes (with concerns to creating a skill without the help of an API and rather a JS program):

- Download the genie sdk and create a new genie skill, this generates a folder with a skill manifest (class definition of the skill)

- Skill manifest contains functions that can be performed by Genie

- #_[canonical=[singular noun phrase for query, imperative verb phrase for action in " "] (can be a list, in qoutes)
This is a tag you use inside each function and for the entire skill that indicates how the genie can form natural language expressions for the skill ie how you 
would construct a command for a function of that skill.
Canonical forms info: https://wiki.almond.stanford.edu/en/references/genie-annotation

- Using APIs: the examples use APIs that seem to be already baked in or something. If you are using a different api need to use
the loader: @org.thingpedia.generic_rest.v1() (you may not im not sure).
and use the tag: #[url=" "]; 

- Parsing API JSON results: This is an example of the first line of a function signature which explains it
query get(out fact : String #[json_key="fact"]) --- You must include the type of output ie String.

- You must train your skills, this will take a few hours and will result in a model that can then be implemented into a genie instance.

NOTE: Use streams and monitor streams to enable a genie program to run in the background once activated so that we can recieve messages automatically.
See monitorable lists (i think that it will update when something is appended to it or perhaps it's just when the function returns.)

Also see:
poll_interval (required for monitorable queries): This is used to specify how often the query will be fired if it is monitored. 
It takes a duration, e.g., #[poll_interval=5min].

Issues: 
- Having trouble training my model.
